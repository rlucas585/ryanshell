- Input doesn't scroll if the cursor is on the first line, and the third line
has gone below the screen (or similar). Fix.
- CTRL-L column position is still not correctly calibrated.
- Add error checking for dup2 calls
- Consider adding one to the value of SHLVL.
- Get signals working (CTRL-C and CTRL-\)
- Tidy up all code (especially in r_execute)
- change input line to vecstr
- Create vecstr type
- Add exit functions, should free:
	- all env values
	- envp in prog
	- The input string (if currently allocated)
- Add a function that will ask for input to continue if the input line ends
while inside of a quote.
