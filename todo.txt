- Add error checking for dup2 calls
- Get signals working (CTRL-C and CTRL-\)
- Tidy up all code (especially in r_execute)
- Add exit functions, should free:
	- all env values
	- envp in prog
	- The input string (if currently allocated)
- Add a function that will ask for input to continue if the input line ends
while inside of a quote.
- Fix the seg fault that occurs if a command has no command (e.g.
`< input_file | more`).
- CTRL-C functions perfectly - except for when the first text entered after
CTRL-C is copy pasted. Fix this.
- Another copy-paste issue: very often, the arrow keys will not have their usual
functionality after copy-pasting, they output strange characters to the screen
instead. Obviously needs fixing.
